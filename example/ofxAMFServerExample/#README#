ofxAMFServer
============
Beta version of AMF server to allow simple remoting between flash and
openFrameworks. Use a basic netconnection in flash, and make a request to the
amf server.

Most basic types are implemented, but none of the object references! 
For simple use cases where you want to get some data from a remote server the 
current implementation will suffice.
